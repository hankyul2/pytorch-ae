# Efficient-VDVAE (2022)

- Problem: Instability issues and demanding computational requirements to train VDVAE.
- Solution: Propose Efficient-VDVAE, which converges up to 2.6x faster than original VDVAE.
- Key method:
  - The number of layers and channel dimensions were reduced.
  - Use gradient smoothing.
